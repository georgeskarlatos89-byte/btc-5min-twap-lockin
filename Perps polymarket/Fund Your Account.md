# Fund Your Account

> Deposit and withdraw pUSD collateral for Perps trading

Fund the Perps account with pUSD before placing orders. Deposits move pUSD from
the user's Polymarket wallet into the Perps account. Withdrawals move available
pUSD back to the authenticated wallet.

## Deposit Collateral

Deposit pUSD when the account needs collateral for opening or maintaining Perps
positions.

      <Step title="Create a Secure Client">
        Create a `SecureClient` for the wallet that will fund the Perps account. If you
        already have a Polymarket wallet, pass it as `wallet` and include a Relayer API
        key so the SDK can submit gasless transactions. If you are creating a wallet
        programmatically, use a Builder API key so the SDK can create the Deposit Wallet
        for that signer.

        <CodeGroup>
          ```ts Existing Account theme={null}
          import { createSecureClient, relayerApiKey } from "@polymarket/client";
          import { privateKey } from "@polymarket/client/viem";

          const client = await createSecureClient({
            wallet: process.env.POLYMARKET_WALLET_ADDRESS!,
            signer: privateKey(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!),
            apiKey: relayerApiKey({
              key: process.env.RELAYER_API_KEY!,
              address: process.env.RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS!,
            }),
          });
          ```

          ```ts New Programmatic Wallet theme={null}
          import { createSecureClient } from "@polymarket/client";
          import { builderApiKey } from "@polymarket/client/node";

          const client = await createSecureClient({
            signer: privateKey(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!),
            apiKey: builderApiKey({
              key: process.env.BUILDER_API_KEY!,
              secret: process.env.BUILDER_SECRET!,
              passphrase: process.env.BUILDER_PASSPHRASE!,

      <Step title="Set Up Deposit Approvals">
        Set up the approvals required for Perps collateral deposits. The SDK skips work
        that is already complete.

      </Step>

      <Step title="Deposit Collateral">
        Deposit pUSD from the user's Polymarket wallet into the Perps account. Make sure
        the wallet has pUSD before depositing. The minimum Perps deposit is 10 pUSD.
        Amounts use raw pUSD base units, so 10 pUSD is `10_000_000n`.

        ```ts theme={null}
        const deposit = await client.depositToPerps({
          amount: 10_000_000n,
        });

        const receipt = await deposit.wait();
        // receipt.transactionHash: TxHash
        ```

        `deposit.wait()` confirms that the chain transaction settled. Perps may take a
        moment to credit the account after that.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Verify the Deposit">
        Open a Perps session and read account state after the deposit settles.

        ```ts theme={null}
        const session = await client.openPerpsSession();

        try {
          const portfolio = await session.fetchPortfolio();
          const pages = session.listDeposits();
          const deposits = await pages.firstPage();
        } finally {
          await session.close();
        }
        ```

        Use `portfolio.withdrawable` to check collateral available for withdrawal and
        `deposits.items` to reconcile deposit history. The `withdrawable` value already
        accounts for the [10% notional reserve](/perps/learn-about-trading/margin#withdrawal-margin-requirements).

  <Tab title="API">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check Deposit Approval">
        Before depositing, the Polymarket wallet must approve the Perps deposit contract
        to spend pUSD. If the approval is already in place, skip the approval call.

        ```solidity Approval Call theme={null}
        pUSD.approve(PerpsDepositContract, maxUint256)
        ```

        Use these contract addresses when building the approval call.

        | Contract               | Address                                      |

        | Perps deposit contract | `0xDCa4af75705dbB50f62437045afF9921947917d2` |

        <Note>
          The following steps show the Deposit Wallet batch path. If you are trading
          with a Safe or Poly Proxy wallet, use an SDK that handles the wallet-specific
          transaction flow for you.
        </Note>

      <Step title="Build the Deposit Call">
        Create the Perps deposit call. Deposit amounts use pUSD base units, so 10 pUSD
        is `10000000`.

        ```solidity theme={null}
        function deposit(address token, uint256 amount, address to);
        ```

        Encode the deposit calldata with these arguments.

        | Argument | Value                                        |

      <Step title="Poll the Deposit Transaction">
        Poll the relayer transaction until it reaches `STATE_CONFIRMED` before relying

        Perps may take a moment to credit the account after the onchain transaction
        settles. Treat `STATE_FAILED` and `STATE_INVALID` as terminal failures.

## Withdraw Collateral

Withdraw pUSD when the account has available collateral that should return to the
authenticated wallet.

Withdrawals must satisfy the [withdrawal margin requirements](/perps/learn-about-trading/margin#withdrawal-margin-requirements),
including the 10% reserve against open-position notional. Collateral available
for trading can therefore exceed collateral available for withdrawal.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    Request a withdrawal to the authenticated wallet.
    Amounts use raw pUSD base units, so 10 pUSD is `10_000_000n`.

    ```ts theme={null}
    const withdrawalId = await client.withdrawFromPerps({
      amount: 10_000_000n,
    });
    ```

    The SDK signs the withdrawal request with the Polymarket account signer and
    returns the Perps withdrawal ID.

    To track the withdrawal, open a Perps session and list withdrawals.

    ```ts theme={null}
    const session = await client.openPerpsSession();

    try {
      const pages = session.listWithdrawals();
      const withdrawals = await pages.firstPage();
    } finally {
      await session.close();
    }
    ```

    To narrow the results to a single state, pass a `withdrawalStatus` filter with
    a `PerpsKnownWithdrawalStatus` member. The filter accepts one status per
    request. For example, list the withdrawals that are still pending:

    ```ts theme={null}
    import { PerpsKnownWithdrawalStatus } from "@polymarket/client";

    const pages = session.listWithdrawals({
      withdrawalStatus: PerpsKnownWithdrawalStatus.Pending,
    });

    for await (const page of pages) {
      // page.items: PerpsWithdrawal[]
    }
    ```

    For what each status means, see
    [Withdrawals](/perps/account-management#withdrawals).

    Sessions](/perps/authenticated-sessions).

    ```

    To narrow the results to a single state, pass a `withdrawal_status` filter.
    The filter accepts one status per request: `"pending"`, `"confirmed"`,
    `"removed"`, or `"failed"`. For example, list the withdrawals that are still
    pending:

    ```python theme={null}
    pages = session.list_withdrawals(withdrawal_status="pending")

    async for page in pages:
        # page.items: tuple[PerpsWithdrawal, ...]

        | Field     | Value                                      |
        | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
        | `account` | Signer address for the Polymarket account. |
        | `token`   | pUSD collateral token address.             |
        | `amount`  | Raw pUSD token amount.                     |
        | `to`      | Wallet that receives the withdrawal.       |
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create Withdrawal Typed Data">
        The withdrawal signature uses EIP-712 typed data with `Withdraw` as the primary
        type. Use the same `account`, `token`, `amount`, and `to` values from the
        withdrawal operation.

        For withdrawals, `ts` is a Unix timestamp in seconds because the onchain contract
        validates it against `block.timestamp`. It must match the `ts` value in the
        request body.

        ```json theme={null}
        {
          "domain": {
            "name": "Polymarket",
            "version": "1",

              { "name": "token", "type": "address" },
              { "name": "amount", "type": "uint256" },
              { "name": "fee", "type": "uint256" },
              { "name": "to", "type": "address" },
              { "name": "salt", "type": "uint64" },
              { "name": "ts", "type": "uint64" }
            ]
          },
          "message": {

          }
        }
        ```

        | Field  | Value                                                |
        | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
        | `salt` | Random integer generated for this signed request.    |
        | `ts`   | Current Unix timestamp in seconds, not milliseconds. |
      </Step>

      <Step title="Sign Withdrawal Typed Data">
        Sign the typed data with the Polymarket account signer. The example below uses
        Viem.

        ```ts Viem theme={null}
        import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";

        const account = privateKeyToAccount("<polymarket_account_signer_private_key>");

        const signature = await account.signTypedData({
          domain: {
            name: "Polymarket",
            version: "1",
            chainId: 137,
            verifyingContract: "0xDCa4af75705dbB50f62437045afF9921947917d2",
          },
          primaryType: "Withdraw",
          types: {
            Withdraw: [
              { name: "account", type: "address" },
              { name: "token", type: "address" },
              { name: "amount", type: "uint256" },
              { name: "fee", type: "uint256" },
              { name: "to", type: "address" },
              { name: "salt", type: "uint64" },
              { name: "ts", type: "uint64" },
            ],
          },
          message: {
            account: "<polymarket_account_signer_address>",
            token: "0xC011a7E12a19f7B1f670d46F03B03f3342E82DFB",
            amount: 10000000n,
            fee: 0n,
            to: "<polymarket_wallet_address>",
            salt: 555555555n,
            ts: 1767000014n,
          },
        });
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Submit the Withdrawal">
        Submit the signed withdrawal request to `POST /v1/account/withdraw`. Use the
        same operation values, `salt`, and `ts` from the typed data.

        ```bash theme={null}
        curl -X POST "https://api.perpetuals.polymarket.com/v1/account/withdraw" \
          -H "content-type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "op": {
              "type": "withdraw",
              "args": {
                "account": "<polymarket_account_signer_address>",
                "token": "0xC011a7E12a19f7B1f670d46F03B03f3342E82DFB",
                "amount": "10000000",
                "to": "<polymarket_wallet_address>"
              }
            },
            "sig": "<signature>",
            "salt": 555555555,
            "ts": 1767000014
          }'
        ```

        The response indicates whether the withdrawal was accepted.

        <CodeGroup>
          ```json Success theme={null}
          {
            "status": "ok",
            "withdraw_id": 1234567890
          }
          ```

          ```json Failure theme={null}
          {
            "status": "err",
            "withdraw_id": 1234567890,
            "error": "insufficient_balance"
          }
          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Track the Withdrawal">
        Use the returned `withdraw_id` to match the withdrawal against history results.

        ```bash theme={null}
        curl -G "https://api.perpetuals.polymarket.com/v1/account/withdrawals" \
          -H "polymarket-proxy: <proxy_address>" \
          -H "polymarket-secret: <proxy_secret>" \
          --data-urlencode "withdrawal_status=pending"
        ```

        The `withdrawal_status` filter accepts `pending`, `confirmed`, `removed`, or
        `failed`.
