# Overview

> Learn how Polymarket organizes market data and where to begin.

Market data starts with identifying the event, market, or outcome your
application cares about. The pages in this section take you from that choice to
the data your application needs.

## Understand the Data Model

On Polymarket, an event groups one or more markets. Each market is a tradable
question with YES and NO outcomes, and each outcome has its own token ID. Use
the token ID for the outcome whose price or order book you want to read.
