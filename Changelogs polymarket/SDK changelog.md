    ### `0.10.0`

    * Breaking change: trade, activity, position, and Combo feeds now use server cursors and automatically retry transient rate limits. Restart scans with a new first page; previously saved cursors are not reusable. Replace `market` filters with `conditionId` and top-level `start`/`end` with `window`. Time windows accept epoch seconds or `Date` values; `window: "full"` requests full history. Condition filters accept at most 20 distinct IDs.

    ```diff theme={null}
    const pages = client.listActivity({
      user,
    -  market: [conditionId],
    -  start,
    -  end,
    +  conditionId: [conditionId],
    +  window: { start, end },
    });
    ```

    * Breaking change: `listPositions(...)` now covers open, redeemable, and closed positions. Replace `listClosedPositions(...)` with `status: PositionStatus.Closed`, and `listMarketPositions(...)` with a public client's `listPositions({ conditionId })`. Market-holder results are individual positions rather than groups by outcome. The default `Open` status includes redeemable positions.

    ```diff theme={null}
    +import { PositionStatus } from "@polymarket/client";

    -const pages = client.listClosedPositions({ user });
    +const pages = client.listPositions({ user, status: PositionStatus.Closed });
    ```

    * Breaking change: secure `listPositions(...)` always selects the authenticated wallet and rejects `user: null`. Use a public client to list a market's holders.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -const pages = secureClient.listPositions({ user: null, market: [conditionId] });
    +const pages = publicClient.listPositions({ conditionId });
    ```

    * Breaking change: position rows expose `currentSize`, `currentPrice`, `totalSize`, and explicit fee-exclusive entry economics. Money, size, price, and PnL values use decimal strings; `entryFeesUsdc` is disclosed separately and must not be deducted from `entryCostUsdc` again. Optional feed metadata now uses `undefined` for absent values, and returned timestamps use epoch milliseconds.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -const shares = position.size;
    -const price = position.curPrice;
    -const bought = position.totalBought;
    +const shares = position.currentSize;
    +const price = position.currentPrice;
    +const bought = position.totalSize;
    ```

    * Breaking change: request vocabularies now use exported enums, including `SortDirection`, `TradeFilterType`, `PositionFilterType`, `PositionSortBy`, `ComboPositionSortBy`, and `TipSide`. Replace the removed `Side` type with `OrderSide`.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -import type { Side } from "@polymarket/client";
    +import { OrderSide } from "@polymarket/client";

    -const side: Side = "BUY";
    +const side = OrderSide.BUY;
    ```

    * Added migration activity through `ActivityType.MIGRATION` and `MigrationActivity`, plus tip activity through `ActivityType.TIP` and `TipSide`. Combo positions now support `ComboPositionStatus.Redeemable` as a sole status filter.
    * Breaking change: Combo activity includes `positionId` on every row and removes `transactionAt`, `logIndex`, and `moduleId`. Use `timestamp` for the activity time.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -const occurredAt = activity.transactionAt;
    +const occurredAt = activity.timestamp;
    ```

    * Breaking change: `listMarketHolders(...)` now returns a paginator. Pass `conditionIds` and `pageSize`; `minBalance` is measured in display shares. Optional `includePnl` adds gross holdings and position economics for one condition ID with a page size of at most 100. Merge outcome groups across pages by `assetId`.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -const holders = await client.listMarketHolders({ market: [conditionId], limit: 10 });
    +const pages = client.listMarketHolders({ conditionIds: [conditionId], pageSize: 10 });
    +const firstPage = await pages.firstPage();
    +const holders = firstPage.items;
    ```

    * Breaking change: `fetchPortfolioValue(...)` returns one `PortfolioValue` with a decimal-string `value`, and accepts `conditionIds` instead of `market`. Position and portfolio reads also canonicalize Polymarket Protocol V2 condition IDs.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -const [portfolio] = await client.fetchPortfolioValue({ user, market: [conditionId] });
    +const portfolio = await client.fetchPortfolioValue({ user, conditionIds: [conditionId] });
    ```

    * Added `fetchUserStats(...)`, `fetchUserPnl(...)`, and `fetchUserVolume(...)` for account analytics, with authenticated-wallet defaults on secure clients. Breaking change: replace `fetchTradedMarketCount(...)` with the exact distinct-market count on `fetchUserStats(...)`. It returns `null` for an unknown user.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -const count = (await client.fetchTradedMarketCount({ user })).traded;
    +const stats = await client.fetchUserStats({ user });
    +const count = stats?.tradedMarketCount ?? null;
    ```

    * Breaking change: replace `fetchPriceHistory(...)` with cursor-paginated `listPriceHistory(...)`. Pass `assetId` and exactly one time selection: `interval`, `start` with optional `end`, or `asOf`. Replace minute-based `fidelity` with `bucketSeconds`; omit it for automatic resolution. Explicit ranges span at most 15 days. Each point includes a decimal-string price, epoch-millisecond timestamp, and `resolutionSeconds`.

    ```diff theme={null}
    +import { PriceHistoryInterval } from "@polymarket/client";

    -const history = await client.fetchPriceHistory({ assetId, interval: "1d", fidelity: 60 });
    +const pages = client.listPriceHistory({
    +  assetId,
    +  interval: PriceHistoryInterval.OneDay,
    +  bucketSeconds: 3600,
    +});
    +const firstPage = await pages.firstPage();
    +const history = firstPage.items;
    ```

    * Breaking change: replace `listOpenInterest(...)` with `fetchOpenInterest(...)` and pass `conditionIds` for selected markets. Values represent priced gross open interest in USDC.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -const openInterest = await client.listOpenInterest({ market: [conditionId] });
    +const openInterest = await client.fetchOpenInterest({ conditionIds: [conditionId] });
    ```

    * Breaking change: `fetchEventLiveVolume(...)` accepts `eventIds` and returns cumulative taker volume in shares, with market rows in `markets` and a decimal-string `takerVolumeTotal`.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -const volume = await client.fetchEventLiveVolume({ id: eventId });
    +const volume = await client.fetchEventLiveVolume({ eventIds: [eventId] });
    ```

    * Breaking change: builder rankings now return cursor-paginated `BuilderStanding` rows. Builder volume returns complete `BuilderVolumePoint` date buckets; `bucketLimit` bounds buckets rather than builder rows. Replace `timePeriod` with `window` for rankings or `interval` for volume. Use `BuilderVolumeInterval.Year` for yearly buckets.

    ```diff theme={null}
    +import { BuilderVolumeInterval, LeaderboardWindow } from "@polymarket/client";

    -const pages = client.listBuilderLeaderboard({ timePeriod: "MONTH" });
    -const volume = await client.fetchBuilderVolume({ timePeriod: "MONTH" });
    +const pages = client.listBuilderLeaderboard({ window: LeaderboardWindow.Month });
    +const volume = await client.fetchBuilderVolume({ interval: BuilderVolumeInterval.Month });
    ```

    * Breaking change: trader rankings use cursor pagination, `window`, and `sortBy`; the list no longer accepts `user` or `userName` filters. Use `fetchTraderLeaderboardStanding({ user })` for one wallet's standing. Added `listBiggestWinners(...)` with market and Combo variants.

    ```diff theme={null}
    +import { LeaderboardWindow, TraderLeaderboardSort } from "@polymarket/client";

    -const pages = client.listTraderLeaderboard({ timePeriod: "MONTH", orderBy: "PNL" });
    +const pages = client.listTraderLeaderboard({
    +  window: LeaderboardWindow.Month,
    +  sortBy: TraderLeaderboardSort.Pnl,
    +});
    ```

    * Added `fetchResolutions(...)` for resolution lifecycle lookups by question, condition, or event, with typed timestamps, transaction metadata, payouts, and finality. Unset values are omitted.
    * Combo leg markets now preserve `question`, `groupItemTitle`, `sportsMarketType`, `line`, and `outcomes`. Trade activity tolerates unknown outcome metadata.

    ### `0.9.0`

    * Order estimation, preparation, creation, and placement now accept protocol-neutral `assetId` values. Structured Polymarket Protocol V2 position IDs select Polymarket Protocol V2 routing automatically, while `tokenId` remains available as a deprecated alias.
    * Added `fetchTradingApprovalsState(...)` for reading a wallet's missing trading approvals without a signer or transaction workflow. Malformed approval-check responses now raise `UnexpectedResponseError`.
    * Markets and events now expose their protocol through `version`, and markets expose Combo eligibility through `market.state.comboStatus`. Combo status values introduced after this release pass through as strings.
    * Secure account reads now reject invalid request values and `user: null` with `UserInputError` instead of silently selecting the wallet or throwing an untyped error.
    * Session Key authorization and revocation submissions now allow up to five minutes for relayer validation and broadcast.
    * Breaking change: `revokeSessionKey(...)` now resolves to `void` once the Session Key leaves the active registry. The backend continues canceling orders and finalizing the on-chain revocation asynchronously. See [Revoke a Session Key](/trading/session-keys#revoke-a-session-key).

    ```diff theme={null}
    -const revocation = await secureClient.revokeSessionKey({
    +await secureClient.revokeSessionKey({
      address: sessionKeyAddress,
    });
    ```

    * Team entries on event and team-list responses now preserve their `ordering` value.
    * Breaking change: removed legacy AMM fields from market and event models, along with the `marketMakerAddresses` filter on `listMarkets(...)`. Responses that still contain the removed fields continue to parse, but those values are ignored. Use the supported CLOB metrics where applicable.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -const volume = market.metrics.volumeAmm;
    +const volume = market.metrics.volumeClob;
    ```

    ### `0.8.1`

    * `client.authorizeSessionKey(...)` no longer accepts `validUntil`. This is a breaking change. Each Session Key authorization expires after 180 days. Revoke a Session Key to end access sooner.

    ```diff theme={null}
    const authorization = await client.authorizeSessionKey({
      address: sessionKeyAddress,
    -  validUntil: new Date(Date.now() + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
    });
    ```

    ### `0.8.0`

    * Added protocol-neutral `assetId` and `conditionId` fields to CLOB reads, filters, realtime events, and Data API responses. The deprecated `tokenId`, `tokenIds`, and `market` aliases still work.
    * Position lifecycle methods now split, merge, and redeem ordinary Polymarket Protocol V2 positions. Redemption by position ID supports binary, negative-risk, and Combo positions.
    * `setupTradingApprovals()` and `prepareTradingApprovals()` now include the Polymarket Protocol V2 binary and negative-risk modules.
    * Combo market discovery now exposes whether a market is `pending` and excludes pending markets when selecting live RFQ legs.
    * Live volume reads now return `null` for empty market identifiers.
    * Renamed the low-level CTF and Router transaction builders and their error guards to contract-specific names. This is a breaking change for callers that import them directly.

    ```diff theme={null}
    import {
    -  mergePositionsCall,
    -  mergeV2Call,
    -  redeemV2Call,
    -  splitPositionCall,
    -  splitV2Call,
    +  ctfMergePositionsCall,
    +  ctfSplitPositionCall,
    +  routerMergeCall,
    +  routerRedeemCall,
    +  routerSplitCall,
    } from "@polymarket/client";
    ```

    ### `0.7.0`

    * Added scoped Deposit Wallet session keys through `client.authorizeSessionKey(...)`, `client.fetchSessionKeys()`, and `client.revokeSessionKey(...)`. Secure clients can use an authorized session signer for ordinary operations. Scopes default to `ALL`; known scopes are enumerated while newer scope strings remain usable.
    * Account notifications now use a `NotificationType`-discriminated union with a typed payload for every supported kind. `fetchNotifications(...)` omits kinds unknown to this SDK version and rejects a response when a recognized kind has a malformed payload.
    * `RateLimitError.rateLimit` now carries the `Poly-RateLimit-*` state returned with a rejection. Pass `onRateLimitUpdate` when creating a client to receive per-signer bucket, remaining, reset, tier, and warning updates from any response that reports them.
    * Order estimation, preparation, creation, and placement now accept Polymarket Protocol V2 position IDs and route them through Exchange V3 signing and trading approvals. Existing token-ID orders remain supported.
    * `listComboPositions(...)` now accepts either one status or an array of statuses.
    * `RequestRejectedError.restriction` distinguishes matching-engine restarts from post-only mode, and `retryAfter` falls back to the response body's `retry_after_seconds` value when the header is absent. Batch post-only rejections now use the `post_only_mode` order error code.
    * Order preparation now tolerates insignificant floating-point drift on valid tick-grid prices and uses exact fixed-point amount calculations. CLOB salts that cannot round-trip through a JavaScript number are rejected before submission.
    * Breaking change: deprecated `CtfConditionId` type, use ConditionId\` instead.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -import type { CtfConditionId } from "@polymarket/client";
    +import type { ConditionId } from "@polymarket/client";
    ```

    ### `0.6.0`

    * Added requester-side Combos RFQ support through `client.requestComboQuote(...)`, `client.acceptComboQuote(...)`, and `client.waitForComboFill(...)`. You can also call `fetchRfqStatus` from `@polymarket/client/actions`. Authenticate requests with `builderApiKey(...)` or `remoteBuilderSigning(...)`. Winning quotes can be stored as JSON, and SELL quotes include the exact post-fee `netReceive`. No-quote, decline, and expiry outcomes return values. Gateway rejections throw `RfqRequestRejectedError`.
    * Market outcomes now include a nullable Polymarket Protocol V2 `positionId` alongside the CLOB `tokenId`. New code should use the protocol-neutral `ConditionId`, `ConditionIdSchema`, `OptionalConditionIdSchema`, and `toConditionId`. The CTF-named aliases and market-level `positionIds` array remain available for compatibility but are deprecated.
    * Breaking change: `client.fetchLastTradePrice(...)` now returns `LastTradePrice | null`. It returns `null` when the token has not traded. `client.fetchLastTradePrices(...)` leaves untraded tokens out of the response, so match results by `tokenId` instead of array position.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -const price = (await client.fetchLastTradePrice({ tokenId })).price;
    +const lastTrade = await client.fetchLastTradePrice({ tokenId });
    +const price = lastTrade?.price ?? null;
    ```

    ### `0.5.0`

    * Added a Perps dead man's switch: `session.armAutoCancel()` schedules a one-shot cancel-all, `session.disarmAutoCancel()` clears it, and `session.fetchAutoCancelStatus()` reports the current deadline and daily trigger usage. Arming after the daily limit raises `AutoCancelDailyLimitError`.
    * Perps funding history and realtime funding events now include a required `id`, typed as `PerpsFundingPaymentId`.
    * Fixed `session.placeOrder()` missing private order updates that arrive before the command acknowledgement. When the caller omits a client order ID, the SDK now generates one before submitting the order.

    ### `0.4.0`

    * Added `PerpsSession.updateMargin`, which adjusts isolated margin for an instrument position. Positive `amount` values add margin; negative values remove it.
    * Repeated order preparation now caches market configuration and platform and builder fees. If cached tick data rejects a limit or protected market price, the SDK fetches current metadata once before returning the input error.
    * Unprotected market orders now derive depth, price, tick size, and exchange selection from one live order book response. `maxSpend` remains an estimated all-in spend target based on recently resolved fees, not a hard cap.
    * `AcceptedOrderResponse.orderId` is now typed as `OrderId`.
    * Breaking TypeScript type change: `OrderBook.tickSize` is now a numeric `TickSizeValue` instead of a `DecimalString`.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -const isOneCentTick = orderBook.tickSize === "0.01";
    +const isOneCentTick = orderBook.tickSize === 0.01;
    ```

    ### `0.3.0`

    * Added typed 30-second and 60-second Chainlink TWAP realtime subscriptions. `subscribe` validates subscription input when called: an unsupported TWAP window throws `UserInputError` before the connection opens.
    * Added Perps account notifications: `session.listNotifications()`, `session.fetchUnreadNotificationsCount()`, `session.markNotificationsRead()`, and a `notifications` session WebSocket channel with typed `notification` events.
    * Perps fills pagination now uses the API-native cursor and adds a `sort` direction option (newest first by default). Previously issued SDK-encoded fills cursors no longer work.
    * Added the `DEPOSIT`, `WITHDRAWAL`, and `TAKER_REBATE` activity types. `listActivity` now returns all activity types by default, including deposits and withdrawals.
    * `RequestRejectedError` and `RateLimitError` now expose `retryAfter` from the `Retry-After` response header.
    * Fixes:
      * Open order `createdAt` and `expiresAt` now parse epoch-seconds wire timestamps correctly instead of treating them as milliseconds.
      * RFQ quote rejections now carry the granular Combos quote-validation error codes instead of a generic validation failure.
      * Deposit Wallet gasless and Collateral Return submits now self-heal nonce mismatches: when the relayer rejects a batch and reports the on-chain nonce, the SDK re-signs the batch with that nonce and resubmits it once.
      * Cursor-paginated reads no longer report the per-page item count as `Page.totalCount`. Use `page.items.length` instead.

    ### `0.2.0`

    * Added `client.waitForOrderFillSettlement(order)`, which waits until every fill in an order response reaches a terminal settlement outcome and returns the settlement transaction hashes. Matched order responses are no longer guaranteed to include `transactionsHashes`; use this method to obtain hashes reliably.
    * `ClobTrade.status` is now typed with the shared `TradeStatus` enum instead of a plain string.
    * Added Collateral Return support: `planCollateralReturn` returns an inspectable plan and `executeCollateralReturnPlan` signs and submits it for Deposit Wallet, Safe, and Proxy accounts, returning a transaction handle.
    * Added `isolatedOnly` to `PerpsInstrument`, indicating whether the instrument supports only isolated margin.
    * Added volume-based fee tiers to the Perps fee schedule: each `PerpsFeeScheduleEntry` carries a `tiers` array of `PerpsFeeTier` values, including negative maker rebate rates.
    * Perps withdrawal statuses are now forward-compatible: known statuses are enumerated in `PerpsKnownWithdrawalStatus`, which adds `failed`, and statuses introduced after a release flow through as plain strings instead of failing the response parse.
    * Deprecated the `PerpsWithdrawalStatus` value alias; migrate enum member access:

    ```diff theme={null}
    -if (withdrawal.status === PerpsWithdrawalStatus.Confirmed) {
    +if (withdrawal.status === PerpsKnownWithdrawalStatus.Confirmed) {
    ```

    * Fixed offset-paginated list methods silently stopping after the first page when `pageSize` reached the server's limit cap. `pageSize` is now validated per endpoint and values above the cap are rejected with `UserInputError`. A full page reports `hasMore: true`; when a collection ends exactly on a page boundary, the final page is empty.
    * Limit and protected market order prices must be a multiple of the market tick size. Off-grid prices (for example `0.007` on a `0.005` tick market) are now rejected client-side instead of by the exchange after signing.

    ### `0.1.0`

    * Graduated the SDK to the stable 0.x release line, marked Perps APIs as experimental, and removed deprecated compatibility APIs.
    * Added Perps support for reduce-only orders, account stats, cancel-all, TP/SL metadata and placement, batched fill and trade frames, and stricter order request validation.
    * Added `conditionId` aliases to CLOB order book, open order, trade, and builder trade models while keeping `market` available as a deprecated alias.
    * Typed CLOB cancellation results with branded `OrderId` values for `canceled` and `notCanceled` keys.

    ### `0.1.0-beta.18`

    * `setupTradingApprovals` and `prepareTradingApprovals` no longer request approvals for the retired CLOB v1 Neg Risk Adapter.
    * Streams drop unknown or unreadable WebSocket frames instead of closing the connection. RFQ quoter sessions no longer fail with `TransportError` on an unrecognized frame; a caller waiting on an unreadable acknowledgement fails through its acknowledgement timeout instead.
    * Removed `RfqKnownInboundMessageSchema` from `@polymarket/bindings`; each RFQ inbound message schema declares its own object shape directly.

    ### `0.1.0-beta.17`

    * RFQ quoter sessions now keep running when the server introduces new error codes. `RfqErrorCode` is an open type: known codes are enumerated in `RfqKnownErrorCode`, and unrecognized codes flow through rejection errors as plain strings.
    * Deprecated the `RfqErrorCode` value alias; migrate enum member access:

    ```diff theme={null}
    -if (error.code === RfqErrorCode.RateLimited) {
    +if (error.code === RfqKnownErrorCode.RateLimited) {
    ```

    * Added `ConnectionLostError` carrying the WebSocket close `code` and `reason`. Losing an RFQ session connection now rejects in-flight operations and fails the session iterator with it, instead of ending the event loop silently. Closing the session still ends iteration cleanly.
    * Streamed market and user events normalize empty-string optional decimal fields (for example a trade's `feeRateBps` or a price change's `bestBid` and `bestAsk`) to `null`.
    * Batch price reads (`fetchPrices`, `fetchMidpoints`, `fetchSpreads`) return `TokenId`-keyed records of branded decimal strings.
    * Perps sessions handle fills and trades frames that batch multiple entries.

    ### `0.1.0-beta.16`

    * Added `RESOLVED_PARTIAL` to `ComboPositionStatus` so Combo positions that resolve at a fractional payout (for example a voided leg) parse correctly instead of failing validation.

    ### `0.1.0-beta.15`

    * Combo activity now parses the canonical `type` field returned by the Data API, instead of deriving lifecycle actions from legacy fields.

    ### `0.1.0-beta.14`

    * Added SDK pagination for Combo lifecycle activity and server-cursor pagination for Combo positions.
    * Added Combo position sync request fields and exposed `outcome` and `redeemable` on Combo positions.
    * Branded Combo activity row IDs.
    * Breaking beta change: Combo activity and position fields now use `wallet`, `amount`, and `payout`; Combo activity rows no longer expose `moduleKind`.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -activity.userAddress
    -activity.amountUsdc
    -redeemActivity.payoutUsdc
    -position.userAddress
    +activity.wallet
    +activity.amount
    +redeemActivity.payout
    +position.wallet
    ```

    ### `0.1.0-beta.13`

    * Added `listMarketClarifications` for reading market clarification text with SDK-owned pagination and market, event, state, question, and transaction filters.
    * Fixed legacy Proxy wallet gasless execution and added live Safe and Proxy wallet coverage.
    * Resolve closed markets when preparing market position redemptions.
    * Gasless transaction handles now wait for relayer transactions to reach confirmed state before resolving.

    ### `0.1.0-beta.12`

    * Require GTD limit order expirations to be at least 3 minutes in the future.

    ### `0.1.0-beta.11`

    * Support CLOB order tick sizes `0.005` and `0.0025`.
    * Pagination request cursors now infer the branded pagination cursor type.

    ### `0.1.0-beta.10`

    * Preserve already-deployed legacy UUPS Deposit Wallets when `createSecureClient` resolves the default wallet, while new Deposit Wallet deployments use the beacon factory path.

    ### `0.1.0-beta.9`

    * Added `PriceHistoryInterval` and `SearchSort` exports, preserved `groupItemTitle` on normalized markets, and published `expectPrivateKey` from `@polymarket/types`.

    ### `0.1.0-beta.8`

    * RFQ quoter sessions now emit typed `trade` events for confirmed Combos fills.
    * RFQ rejection errors now expose `errorId` values and parse `INVALID_SIGNATURE` and `INTERNAL_ERROR` codes.

    ### `0.1.0-beta.7`

    * Added `parentEventId` to `Event` so child events can link back to their parent event.
    * Added `maxPrice` and `minPrice` protection fields to market order requests.
    * Handle legacy multi-outcome markets more safely: `listMarkets` skips markets that cannot be represented by the binary market model, and `fetchMarket` returns a typed SDK error for unsupported markets.
    * Normalize empty-string order and activity fields to SDK values: decimal amounts become `"0"`, missing maker order fee rates become `null`, and missing trade or position market icons become `null`.
    * Parse Combo trade activity rows with an `isCombo` discriminated union.
    * Support new Combos RFQ websocket error codes for balance, allowance, and pre-execution reservation failures.
    * Broad user websocket subscriptions now omit market filters so all-market streams receive trade events.
    * Retry rejected JSON-RPC `eth_call` batches by splitting them into smaller batches.

    ### `0.1.0-beta.6`

    * Point Combos RFQ endpoints at the production domains: `combos-rfq-api.polymarket.com` (REST) and `combos-rfq-gateway-quoter.polymarket.com` (quoter WebSocket).

    ### `0.1.0-beta.5`

    * Added `listComboMarkets` for fetching the Combo market catalog with typed bindings and SDK-owned pagination. See [Combos](/trading/combos/overview).
    * Parse RFQ quote rejections that use the `SUBMISSION_WINDOW_CLOSED` gateway error code.

    ### `0.1.0-beta.4`

    * Added Combos support for multi-leg RFQ positions. See [Combos](/trading/combos/overview).
    * Reject whitespace-only search queries and trim leading or trailing search input.
    * `ConditionId` is now deprecated in favor of `CtfConditionId`; existing
      `ConditionId` exports remain available as deprecated aliases.

    ### `0.1.0-beta.3`

    **Secure client setup now defaults to the Deposit Wallet flow**

    `createSecureClient` can now derive and use the signer's deterministic Deposit
    Wallet when you omit `wallet`. If you already know which Polymarket wallet you
    want to use, keep passing `wallet`.

    ```diff theme={null}
    const secureClient = await createSecureClient({
    -  wallet: "YOUR_POLYMARKET_WALLET_ADDRESS",
       signer,
    });
    ```

    If you want to keep account selection explicit, no change is required:

    ```ts theme={null}
    const secureClient = await createSecureClient({
      wallet: "YOUR_POLYMARKET_WALLET_ADDRESS",
      signer,
    });
    ```

    **`setupTradingApprovals()` now waits internally**

    You no longer need to wait on the returned handle. Call the method once before
    trading; it is safe to call again if approvals are already set.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -const handle = await secureClient.setupTradingApprovals();
    -await handle.wait();
    +await secureClient.setupTradingApprovals();
    ```

    **Gasless setup helpers are deprecated**

    You no longer need to call `isGaslessReady()` or `setupGaslessWallet()` in the
    normal setup path. Create the secure client, then set up trading approvals.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -const ready = await secureClient.isGaslessReady();
    -
    -if (!ready) {
    -  secureClient = await secureClient.setupGaslessWallet();
    -}
    -
     await secureClient.setupTradingApprovals();
    ```

    ### `0.1.0-beta.2`

    First beta release of the unified TypeScript SDK. Install the beta package with
    your package manager:

    ```bash theme={null}
    pnpm add @polymarket/client@beta
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ### `0.10.0`

    * Breaking change: trade, activity, position, and Combo reads now use server cursors. Restart scans from the first page when upgrading from `0.9.0`. Replace `market` filters with `condition_id`. Time bounds accept epoch seconds or timezone-aware `datetime` values. Use `full_history=True` without `start` or `end` to request full history. Position reads remain unbounded by default, including holdings without an activity timestamp.

    ```diff theme={null}
    pages = client.list_activity(
        user=user,
    -    market=[condition_id],
    +    condition_id=[condition_id],
    )
    ```

    * Breaking change: `list_positions(...)` replaces `list_closed_positions(...)` and `list_market_positions(...)`. Use `status="CLOSED"` for closed positions and `status="REDEEMABLE"` for redeemable positions. For a market's holders, use a public client's `list_positions(condition_id=condition_id)`. Secure clients default to the authenticated wallet. Market position results are individual `Position` rows.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -pages = client.list_closed_positions(user=user)
    +pages = client.list_positions(user=user, status="CLOSED")
    ```

    * Breaking change: position rows now expose `current_size`, `current_price`, `total_size`, and explicit entry costs and fees. Prices, sizes, PnL, and percentages use `Decimal`. `entry_cost_usdc` excludes fees. Do not subtract `entry_fees_usdc` from it again.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -shares = position.size
    -price = position.cur_price
    -bought = position.total_bought
    +shares = position.current_size
    +price = position.current_price
    +bought = position.total_size
    ```

    * Breaking change: replace `get_market_holders(...)` with the paginated `list_market_holders(...)`. Pass `condition_ids` and `page_size`. Merge outcome groups across pages by `asset_id`. `include_pnl=True` adds position economics for one condition with a maximum page size of 100.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -holders = await client.get_market_holders(market=[condition_id], limit=10)
    +pages = client.list_market_holders(condition_ids=[condition_id], page_size=10)
    +page = await pages.first_page()
    +holders = page.items
    ```

    * Breaking change: `get_portfolio_value(...)` returns one `PortfolioValue` instead of a tuple. Portfolio and open-interest filters now use `condition_ids`.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -values = await client.get_portfolio_values(user=user, market=[condition_id])
    -value = values[0].value
    +portfolio = await client.get_portfolio_value(user=user, condition_ids=[condition_id])
    +value = portfolio.value

    -interest = await client.get_open_interests(market=[condition_id])
    +interest = await client.get_open_interests(condition_ids=[condition_id])
    ```

    * Added `get_user_stats(...)`, `get_user_pnl(...)`, and `get_user_volume(...)` for wallet analytics. Breaking change: replace `get_traded_market_count(...)` with `UserStats.traded_market_count`. Statistics return `None` when unavailable. Secure clients default these reads to the authenticated wallet.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -count = (await client.get_traded_market_count(user=user)).traded
    +stats = await client.get_user_stats(user=user)
    +count = stats.traded_market_count if stats is not None else None
    ```

    * Breaking change: replace `get_price_history(...)` with the paginated `list_price_history(...)`. Use `asset_id`, `start`/`end`, and `bucket_seconds` instead of `token_id`, `start_ts`/`end_ts`, and minute-based `fidelity`. Select an interval, a window of at most 15 days, or an exact `as_of` timestamp. Price points now expose `timestamp`, `price`, and `resolution_seconds`.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -points = await client.get_price_history(asset_id=asset_id, interval="1d", fidelity=1)
    +pages = client.list_price_history(asset_id=asset_id, interval="1d", bucket_seconds=60)
    +page = await pages.first_page()
    +points = page.items
    ```

    * Breaking change: trader and builder leaderboards now take lowercase `window` values. Trader sorting uses `sort_by`. Use `get_trader_leaderboard_standing(user=...)` for an individual wallet's rankings. Added `list_biggest_winners(...)` for winning market and Combo positions.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -pages = client.list_trader_leaderboard(time_period="DAY", order_by="PNL")
    +pages = client.list_trader_leaderboard(window="day", sort_by="PNL")

    -pages = client.list_builder_leaderboard(time_period="DAY")
    +pages = client.list_builder_leaderboard(window="day")
    ```

    * Breaking change: `get_builder_volumes(...)` returns `BuilderVolumePoint` calendar buckets. Use `interval` and `bucket_limit`, which counts dates rather than rows.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -volumes = await client.get_builder_volumes(time_period="DAY")
    +volumes = await client.get_builder_volumes(interval="day", bucket_limit=30)
    ```

    * Breaking change: `get_event_live_volume(...)` accepts integer `event_ids` and returns one combined `LiveVolume`. Read `taker_volume_total` for total shares and `markets` for the breakdown.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -volumes = await client.get_event_live_volumes(id=str(event_id))
    +volume = await client.get_event_live_volume(event_ids=[event_id])
    ```

    * Added `get_resolutions(...)` for resolution status and payouts by question, conditions, or events. Resolution payouts preserve their values through serialization and parsing.
    * Breaking change: Combo position sorting now uses separate `sort_by` and `sort_direction` arguments. Status filters accept multiple values, except `"REDEEMABLE"`, which must be used alone. Update bounds accept epoch seconds or timezone-aware `datetime` values.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -pages = client.list_combo_positions(user=user, sort="current_value_desc")
    +pages = client.list_combo_positions(user=user, sort_by="CURRENT_VALUE", sort_direction="DESC")
    ```

    * Added typed migration and tip activity and public activity/status enums. Breaking change: Combo activity now exposes `position_id` and uses `timestamp` instead of `transaction_at`. `log_index` and `module_id` are removed.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -occurred_at = activity.transaction_at
    +occurred_at = activity.timestamp
    ```

    * Data reads now retry short-lived rate limits. Invalid filters, time bounds, event IDs, and cursor inputs raise `UserInputError`. Malformed response identities raise `UnexpectedResponseError`.
    * Fixed UTC interpretation of date-only timestamps, preservation of full position history and zero-valued Combo update bounds, and dataframe exports containing both enum and string activity values.

    ### `0.9.0`

    * Added protocol-neutral `asset_id` and `condition_id` fields across CLOB reads, filters, realtime events, and Data API responses. Pass a CTF token ID or Polymarket Protocol V2 position ID through `asset_id`; the deprecated `token_id`, `token_ids`, and `market` aliases remain available for compatibility.
    * Order estimation, creation, and placement now route Polymarket Protocol V2 position IDs through Exchange V3, and `setup_trading_approvals()` includes the Polymarket Protocol V2 binary and negative-risk modules.
    * Position lifecycle methods now split and merge ordinary Polymarket Protocol V2 positions. `merge_multiple_positions(...)` accepts Polymarket Protocol V2 `position_id` requests, and `redeem_positions(position_id=...)` redeems a resolved Polymarket Protocol V2 position.

    ### `0.8.0`

    * Markets and events now expose their protocol through `version`, and markets expose Combo eligibility through `market.state.combo_status`. Combo status values introduced after this release pass through as strings.
    * Team entries on event and team-list responses now preserve their `ordering` value.
    * Breaking change: `revoke_session_key(...)` now returns `None` once the Session Key leaves the active registry. The SDK retries transient registry reads, while the backend continues canceling orders and finalizing the on-chain revocation asynchronously. See [Revoke a Session Key](/trading/session-keys#revoke-a-session-key).

    ```diff theme={null}
    -transaction = await secure_client.revoke_session_key(
    +await secure_client.revoke_session_key(
        address=session_key_address,
    )
    ```

    * Session Key authorization and revocation submissions now allow up to five minutes for relayer validation and broadcast.

    ### `0.7.1`

    * `authorize_session_key(...)` no longer accepts `valid_until`. This is a breaking change. Each Session Key authorization expires after 180 days. Revoke a Session Key to end access sooner.

    ```diff theme={null}
    authorization = await secure_client.authorize_session_key(
        address=session_key_address,
    -    valid_until=datetime.now(UTC) + timedelta(days=30),
    )
    ```

    ### `0.7.0`

    * Added scoped Deposit Wallet session keys through `authorize_session_key(...)`, `fetch_session_keys()`, and `revoke_session_key(...)` on secure clients. Secure clients can use an authorized session signer for ordinary operations. Scopes default to `ALL`; known scopes are enumerated while newer scope strings remain usable.
    * `RateLimitError.rate_limit` now carries the `Poly-RateLimit-*` state returned with a rejection. Pass `on_rate_limit_update` when creating a client to receive per-signer rate-limit updates from any response that reports them.
    * Added `get_trading_approvals_state(...)` to public and secure clients so applications can inspect missing ERC-20 and ERC-1155 approvals without submitting transactions.
    * `RequestRejectedError.restriction` now distinguishes matching-engine restarts, cancel-only mode, and post-only mode. `retry_after` falls back to the response body's `retry_after_seconds` value when the header is absent.
    * Breaking change: account notifications are now a `NotificationType`-discriminated union whose payloads are typed Pydantic models instead of arbitrary mappings. Narrow on `notification.type`, then read payload fields as attributes.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -if notification.type == 2:
    -    order_id = notification.payload["order_id"]
    +if notification.type == NotificationType.ORDER_FILL:
    +    order_id = notification.payload.order_id
    ```

    ### `0.6.0`

    * Added requester-side Combos RFQ support to `SecureClient` and `AsyncSecureClient` through `request_combo_quote(...)`, `accept_combo_quote(...)`, `wait_for_combo_fill(...)`, and `fetch_rfq_status(...)`. Pass a Builder API key through `api_key=`. `ComboQuote` values can be serialized, and SELL quotes include the exact post-fee `net_receive`. No-quote, decline, expiry, and terminal failure outcomes return values. Gateway rejections raise `RfqRequestRejectedError`.
    * Breaking change: `get_last_trade_price(...)` now returns `LastTradePrice | None`. Untraded tokens return `None` instead of a `Decimal("0.5")` placeholder. `get_last_trade_prices(...)` leaves untraded tokens out of the response, so match results by `token_id` instead of array position.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -price = client.get_last_trade_price(token_id=token_id).price
    +last_trade = client.get_last_trade_price(token_id=token_id)
    +price = last_trade.price if last_trade is not None else None
    ```

    ### `0.5.0`

    * Added a Perps dead man's switch: `session.arm_auto_cancel()` schedules a one-shot cancel-all, `session.disarm_auto_cancel()` clears it, and `session.fetch_auto_cancel_status()` reports the current deadline and daily trigger usage. Arming after the daily limit raises `AutoCancelDailyLimitError`.
    * Perps funding history and realtime funding events now include a required `id`, typed as `PerpsFundingPaymentId`.
    * Fixed `session.place_order()` missing private order updates that arrive before the command acknowledgement. When the caller omits a client order ID, the SDK now generates one before submitting the order.
    * Order placement now caches market configuration and platform and builder fees, reducing repeated metadata reads while refreshing stale tick data before returning an input error.

    ### `0.4.0`

    * Added async `PerpsSession.update_margin`, which adjusts isolated margin for an instrument position. Positive `amount` values add margin; negative values remove it.
    * `AcceptedOrder.order_id` is now typed as `OrderId`.

    ### `0.3.0`

    * Added typed 30-second and 60-second Chainlink TWAP realtime subscriptions.
    * Added Perps account notifications: `session.list_notifications()` with the account's `unread` count on each page, `session.mark_notifications_read()`, and a `notifications` session WebSocket channel with typed `notification` events.
    * Perps fills pagination now uses the API-native cursor, and `list_fills` accepts a `sort` direction (newest first by default).
    * Added the `DEPOSIT`, `WITHDRAWAL`, and `TAKER_REBATE` activity types. `list_activity` now returns all activity types by default, including deposits and withdrawals.
    * `RequestRejectedError` now exposes `retry_after` from the `Retry-After` response header or a `retry_after_seconds` response field.
    * Fixes:
      * RFQ quote rejections now carry the granular Combos quote-validation error codes instead of a generic validation failure.
      * Deposit Wallet gasless and Collateral Return submits now self-heal nonce mismatches: when the relayer rejects a batch and reports the on-chain nonce, the SDK re-signs the batch with that nonce and resubmits it once.
      * Collateral Return operation `event_id` values are now typed as `EventId`.

    ### `0.2.0`

    * Added `wait_for_order_fill_settlement`, which waits until every fill in an order response reaches a terminal settlement outcome and returns the settlement transaction hashes.
    * Added Collateral Return support to secure clients: `plan_collateral_return` returns an inspectable plan and `execute_collateral_return_plan` signs and submits it for Deposit Wallet, Safe, and Proxy accounts, returning a transaction handle.
    * Added `isolated_only` to Perps instruments, indicating whether the instrument supports only isolated margin.
    * Added volume-based fee tiers to the Perps fee schedule, including negative maker rebate rates, typed with `PerpsFeeTier`.
    * Perps withdrawal statuses are now forward-compatible: known statuses are enumerated in `PerpsKnownWithdrawalStatus`, which adds `failed`, and statuses introduced after a release flow through as plain strings instead of failing the response parse. `list_withdrawals` accepts `withdrawal_status="failed"`.
    * Fixed offset-paginated reads silently stopping after the first page when `page_size` reached the server's limit cap. `page_size` is now validated per endpoint and values above the cap raise `UserInputError`. A full page reports `has_more=True`; when a collection ends exactly on a page boundary, the final page is empty.
    * CLOB cursor-paginated reads no longer report the per-page row count as `Page.total_count`; it was never the total across pages. Use the page items instead:

    ```diff theme={null}
    -count = page.total_count
    +count = len(page.items)
    ```

    * Open orders with no expiration now parse `expires_at` as `None`. GTC orders report a zero expiration, which previously parsed as the Unix epoch.

    ### `0.1.0`

    * Graduated the SDK to the stable 0.x release line, marked Perps APIs as experimental, and removed deprecated beta compatibility APIs.
    * Added `condition_id` aliases to CLOB models while keeping `market` available as a deprecated alias.
    * Typed CLOB cancellation result IDs with `OrderId`.
    * Streams drop unknown or unreadable WebSocket frames instead of closing the connection.
    * Limit and market order helpers reject prices that are not a multiple of the market tick size.

    ### `0.1.0b21`

    * `setup_trading_approvals` no longer requests approvals for the retired CLOB v1 Neg Risk Adapter.

    ### `0.1.0b20`

    * RFQ quoter sessions now keep running when the server introduces new error codes: unrecognized codes are carried on rejection errors as plain strings, while known codes stay typed through the `RfqErrorCode` enum.
    * Added `ConnectionLostError` carrying the WebSocket close `code` and `reason`. Losing an RFQ session connection now raises it from in-flight operations and the session iterator, instead of a generic `TransportError`. Closing the session still ends iteration cleanly.
    * Optional decimal fields on streamed market and user events treat empty strings as absent (for example a trade's `fee_rate_bps` or a price change's `best_bid` and `best_ask`).
    * Batch price reads return `TokenId`-keyed maps.
    * Perps streams handle fill and trade frames that batch multiple entries.

    ### `0.1.0b19`

    * Added `RESOLVED_PARTIAL` to `ComboPositionStatus` so Combo positions that resolve at a fractional payout (for example a voided leg) parse correctly instead of failing validation.

    ### `0.1.0b18`

    * Combo activity now parses the canonical `type` field returned by the Data API, instead of deriving lifecycle actions from legacy fields.

    ### `0.1.0b17`

    * Added SDK pagination for Combo lifecycle activity and server-cursor pagination for Combo positions.
    * Added typed overloads for market, event, and tag lookups, mutually-exclusive lookup arguments, and `redeem_positions`.
    * Added trade time filters.
    * Hardened Combo pagination filters and branded Combo activity IDs.
    * Breaking beta change: Combo activity and position fields now use `wallet`, `amount`, and `payout`; Combo activity rows no longer expose `module_kind`.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -activity.user_address
    -activity.amount_usdc
    -redeem_activity.payout_usdc
    -position.user_address
    +activity.wallet
    +activity.amount
    +redeem_activity.payout
    +position.wallet
    ```

    ### `0.1.0b16`

    * Fixed Deposit Wallet trading setup approvals to use the current Protocol V2 auto-redeem operator.

    ### `0.1.0b15`

    * Added support for Perps.

    ### `0.1.0b14`

    * Added builder API key management for creating, fetching, and revoking builder API keys.
    * Added support for merging multiple positions in one request.
    * Added runnable Python SDK examples for common integration workflows.
    * Resolve closed markets when redeeming positions.
    * Gasless transaction handles now wait for relayer transactions to reach confirmed state before resolving.

    ### `0.1.0b13`

    * Require GTD limit order expirations to be at least 3 minutes in the future.

    ### `0.1.0b12`

    * Support CLOB order tick sizes `0.005` and `0.0025`.

    ### `0.1.0b11`

    * Preserve already-deployed legacy UUPS Deposit Wallets when secure clients resolve the default wallet, while new Deposit Wallet deployments use the beacon factory path.
    * Retry rejected JSON-RPC batches by splitting them into smaller batches.
    * Added typed Gamma search sort fields for search requests.

    ### `0.1.0b10`

    * Preserve `group_item_title` on market responses so grouped market titles remain available after normalization.

    ### `0.1.0b9`

    * RFQ quoter sessions now emit typed `RfqTradeEvent` events for confirmed Combos fills.
    * RFQ rejection errors now expose `error_id` values and parse `INVALID_SIGNATURE` and `INTERNAL_ERROR` codes.

    ### `0.1.0b8`

    * Added `parent_event_id` to `Event` so child events can link back to their parent event.
    * Added `max_price` and `min_price` protection fields to market order requests.
    * Handle legacy multi-outcome market listings more safely by omitting markets that cannot be represented by the binary market model.
    * Normalize empty-string trade and position market icons to `None`.
    * Parse Combo trade activity rows correctly.
    * Support new Combos RFQ error codes for balance, allowance, and pre-execution reservation failures.
    * Broad user websocket subscriptions now omit market filters so all-market streams receive trade events.

    ### `0.1.0b7`

    * Point Combos RFQ endpoints at the production domains: `combos-rfq-api.polymarket.com` (REST) and `combos-rfq-gateway-quoter.polymarket.com` (quoter WebSocket).

    ### `0.1.0b6`

    * Added `list_combo_markets` for fetching the Combo market catalog with SDK pagination. See [Combos](/trading/combos/overview).
    * Parse RFQ quote rejections that use the `SUBMISSION_WINDOW_CLOSED` gateway error code.

    ### `0.1.0b5`

    * Added Combos support for multi-leg RFQ positions. See [Combos](/trading/combos/overview).
    * Added notebook-friendly model display for Jupyter workflows.
    * `ConditionId` is now deprecated in favor of `CtfConditionId`; existing
      `ConditionId` exports remain available as deprecated aliases.

    ### `0.1.0b4`

    * Added dataframe conversion support for SDK models and response collections.

    **Secure client setup now defaults to the Deposit Wallet flow**

    `AsyncSecureClient.create` can now derive and use the signer's deterministic
    Deposit Wallet when you omit `wallet`. If you already know which Polymarket
    wallet you want to use, keep passing `wallet`.

    ```diff theme={null}
    secure_client = await AsyncSecureClient.create(
        private_key=os.environ["POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY"],
    -    wallet=os.environ["POLYMARKET_WALLET_ADDRESS"],
    )
    ```

    If you want to keep account selection explicit, no change is required:

    ```python theme={null}
    secure_client = await AsyncSecureClient.create(
        private_key=os.environ["POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY"],
        wallet=os.environ["POLYMARKET_WALLET_ADDRESS"],
    )
    ```

    **`setup_trading_approvals()` now waits internally**

    You no longer need to wait on the returned handle. Call the method once before
    trading; it is safe to call again if approvals are already set.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -handle = await secure_client.setup_trading_approvals()
    -await handle.wait()
    +await secure_client.setup_trading_approvals()
    ```

    **Gasless setup helpers are deprecated**

    You no longer need to call `is_gasless_ready()` or `setup_gasless_wallet()` in
    the normal setup path. Create the secure client, then set up trading approvals.

    ```diff theme={null}
    -ready = await secure_client.is_gasless_ready()
    -
    -if not ready:
    -    secure_client = await secure_client.setup_gasless_wallet()
    -
     await secure_client.setup_trading_approvals()
    ```

    ### `0.1.0b1`

    First beta release of the unified Python SDK. Install the beta package with your
    package manager:

    ```bash theme={null}
    uv add polymarket-client
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
