# Withdraw

> Bridge pUSD from Polymarket to any supported chain

Withdraw pUSD from your Polymarket wallet to any supported chain and token. Funds are automatically bridged and swapped to your desired token on the destination chain.

## How It Works

1. Specify your destination chain, token, and recipient address
2. Receive bridge addresses for each destination chain (EVM, Solana, Bitcoin)
3. Send pUSD from your Polymarket wallet to the appropriate bridge address
4. Funds are automatically bridged and swapped to your desired token
5. Funds arrive at your destination wallet

<Warning>
  Do not pre-generate withdrawal addresses. Only generate them when you are
  ready to execute the withdrawal. Each address is configured for a specific
  destination.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  When withdrawing, pUSD is unwrapped to USDC via the Collateral Offramp and
  swapped through the [Uniswap v3
  pool](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xd36ec33c8bed5a9f7b6630855f1533455b98a418)
  for USDC (native). The UI enforces less than 10bp difference in output amount.
  At times, this pool may be exhausted. If you are having withdraw issues, try
  breaking your withdraw into smaller amounts or waiting for the pool to be
  rebalanced. Alternatively, you can withdraw pUSD directly, which does not
  require Uniswap liquidity — just be aware that some exchanges no longer accept
  pUSD deposits directly.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  For very large withdrawals (over \$50,000), consider breaking the withdrawal
  into smaller amounts or using a third-party bridge to minimize slippage.
</Tip>

## Create Withdrawal Addresses

Generate bridge addresses configured for your withdrawal destination. See [Create withdrawal addresses](/api-reference/bridge/create-withdrawal-addresses) for the full request and response schemas.

<Tip>
  **Builders: attach your code.** If you route user funds through this endpoint,
  pass your builder code via the optional `X-Builder-Code` header (bytes32 hex;
  `0x` + 64 hex chars). It lets our bridge provider attribute traffic to your
  app, so stuck or delayed transfers can be traced and prioritized. The header
  is optional. Requests without it still succeed but return a
  `missing_builder_code` warning, and a malformed code returns `400`. Get your
  code at [Settings → Builder](https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder).
</Tip>

Tell the bridge where you're sending funds, including the destination chain, the destination token, and the recipient wallet, and it hands back one address per address type.

```bash theme={null}
curl -X POST https://bridge.polymarket.com/withdraw \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Builder-Code: <builder_code>" \
  -d '{
    "address": "0x9156dd10bea4c8d7e2d591b633d1694b1d764756",
    "toChainId": "1",
    "toTokenAddress": "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
    "recipientAddr": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
  }'
```

```json theme={null}
{
  "address": {
    "evm": "0x23566f8b2E82aDfCf01846E54899d110e97AC053",
    "svm": "CrvTBvzryYxBHbWu2TiQpcqD5M7Le7iBKzVmEj3f36Jb",
    "btc": "bc1q8eau83qffxcj8ht4hsjdza3lha9r3egfqysj3g"
  },
  "note": "Send funds to these addresses to bridge to your destination chain and token."
}
```

Your Polymarket wallet lives on Polygon, so you always send pUSD to the `evm` address. The response also carries bridge addresses for the other chain families because withdrawals and deposits share the same response format. Ignore those addresses when withdrawing.

### Address Types

| Address | Use For                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `evm`   | Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, and other EVM chains |
| `svm`   | Solana                                                   |
| `btc`   | Bitcoin                                                  |
| `tron`  | Tron                                                     |

Withdrawals are **instant** and **free** — Polymarket does not charge withdrawal fees.
