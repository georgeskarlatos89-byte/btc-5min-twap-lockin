# Overview

> Start here for Polymarket perpetual markets

Polymarket [Perps](https://polymarket.com/perps) are perpetual contracts that
track an underlying asset such as an index, commodity, crypto asset, or equity.
Perps trade continuously and do not expire, so traders can open, manage, and
close leveraged positions without waiting for a market resolution event.

## How Perps Work

A Perps trade starts as an order in the order book. When it fills, it becomes a
position whose value changes as the tracked market moves, until the trader closes
it or the system closes it because the account can no longer support the risk.

  <Card title="Prices" icon="chart-line">
    A Perps market has a traded price from the order book and reference prices
    used by the system. The index price tracks the underlying asset, while the
    mark price is used for account equity, margin checks, and liquidation risk.

  <Card title="Trading Positions" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left">
    Trading a Perps market creates or changes a position. A long position benefits
    when the tracked asset rises, and a short position benefits when it falls.
    Orders trade through the order book; fills update the account's position,
    balance, and history.

  <Card title="Margin And Liquidation" icon="shield">
    Perps require collateral to support open positions. That collateral is the
    account's margin: the buffer that covers losses while a position is open. If
    account equity falls too far relative to the required margin, the position can
    be liquidated to close exposure.

  <Card title="Funding Payments" icon="repeat">
    Funding payments keep the contract price close to the index price. When a
    market trades above its index price, long positions generally pay short
    positions. When it trades below its index price, shorts generally pay longs.
