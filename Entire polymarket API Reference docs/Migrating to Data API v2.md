# Migrating to Data API v2

> Move an integration from the original Data API routes to their v2 counterparts: the route mapping, the contract changes, and what stays on v1.

Data API v2 replaces the original per-route contracts with one shared contract
across every read. The original routes keep working, so you can migrate one
call site at a time, but new integrations should start on v2 directly.

<Note>
  This page is about the Data API served at `data-api.polymarket.com`. It is
  unrelated to [CLOB V2](/v2-migration), the trading infrastructure upgrade.

## What Changed

**Response envelope.** v1 routes return bare arrays or objects. Every v2
response wraps its payload in `data`, and paginated routes add a `pagination`
object. A documented miss is `data: null` or an empty list, never an error.

**Pagination.** v1 pages with `limit`/`offset`, and `offset` stops at 10,000
rows. v2 pages with an opaque cursor: follow `pagination.next_cursor` until it
is `null`, with no offset arithmetic to manage, and the feed routes stay
consistent while new rows arrive. See
[Paginate With Cursors](/api-reference/data-api/overview#paginate-with-cursors).

**Field casing.** v1 responses are `camelCase` (`proxyWallet`, `conditionId`).
v2 responses are `snake_case` (`proxy_wallet`, `condition_id`). Request
parameters accept both spellings on v2.

**Market selection.** v1 selects markets with the `market` parameter. v2
unifies on `condition` (aliases `condition_id`, `conditionId`), taking at most
20 distinct comma-separated condition ids. `event_id` filtering carries over.

**Position lifecycle.** v2 folds three v1 routes into one:
`GET /v2/positions` serves the whole lifecycle behind a `status` filter
(`OPEN`, `REDEEMABLE`, `CLOSED`) with `redeemable` and `mergeable` flags on
every row, replacing the separate `/closed-positions` and
`/v1/market-positions` routes.

## Route Mapping

| v1 route                       | v2 route                          | Notes                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /positions`               | `GET /v2/positions`               | `status` defaults to open positions. `market` becomes `condition`             |
| `GET /closed-positions`        | `GET /v2/positions?status=CLOSED` | Folded into the unified lifecycle                                             |
| `GET /v1/market-positions`     | `GET /v2/positions?condition=…`   | Market-anchored listing through the same route                                |
| `GET /trades`                  | `GET /v2/trades`                  |                                                                               |
| `GET /activity`                | `GET /v2/activity`                |                                                                               |
| `GET /v1/activity/combos`      | `GET /v2/activity/combos`         |                                                                               |
| `GET /v1/positions/combos`     | `GET /v2/positions/combos`        |                                                                               |
| `GET /value`                   | `GET /v2/value`                   |                                                                               |
| `GET /traded`                  | `GET /v2/user-stats`              | `data.trades` is the distinct-market count. Unknown users return `data: null` |
| `GET /holders`                 | `GET /v2/holders`                 | Optional `include_pnl=true` adds entry and PnL economics per holder           |
| `GET /oi`                      | `GET /v2/oi`                      |                                                                               |
| `GET /live-volume`             | `GET /v2/live-volume`             |                                                                               |
| `GET /v1/leaderboard`          | `GET /v2/leaderboard`             |                                                                               |
| `GET /v1/builders/leaderboard` | `GET /v2/builders/leaderboard`    |                                                                               |
| `GET /v1/builders/volume`      | `GET /v2/builders/volume`         |                                                                               |
|                                | `GET /v2/approvals`               |                                                                               |

Each v2 endpoint page documents its full parameter set and row shape; several
routes accept filters their v1 counterparts did not.

## New in v2

v2 adds these reads. User stats also covers the existing traded-market count:

| Route                     | Returns                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `GET /v2/user-pnl`        | A user's PnL series     |
| `GET /v2/user-stats`      | A user's profile stats  |
| `GET /v2/user-volume`     | A user's trading volume |
| `GET /v2/biggest-winners` | The biggest wins        |
| `GET /v2/prices-history`  | A token's price history |
| `GET /v2/resolutions`     | Resolution state        |
| `GET /v2/status`          | Data freshness          |

## Staying on v1

`GET /v1/accounting/snapshot` has no v2 counterpart. Keep calling its existing route.

## SDK Migration to Data API V2

Data API v2 is supported starting with version `0.10.0` in both official SDKs:
the TypeScript package `@polymarket/client` and the Python package
`polymarket-client`. Review the
[TypeScript SDK changelog](/changelog/sdks#typescript) or
[Python SDK changelog](/changelog/sdks#python) for the breaking changes,
renamed methods, response fields, and pagination behavior to update when
migrating.
