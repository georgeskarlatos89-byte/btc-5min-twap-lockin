# Get user combo positions

> **Data API v2:** this route has a v2 counterpart, `GET /v2/positions/combos`. See [Migrating to Data API v2](/api-reference/data-api/migrating-from-v1).
Combinatorial (multi-market) positions held by a user, with per-leg breakdown. Also available at /v1/data/user/{address}/positions/combos (address from the path). Open positions with shares_balance below 0.001 are omitted (dust floor — e.g. sub-0.001 remainders left by "sell all" cashouts); resolved positions are served regardless of balance.
