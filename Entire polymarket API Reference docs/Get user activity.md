            tokens burned for this row's outcome, so redeeming both sides of a

          description: >-
            USDC amount for this row. On `REDEEM` rows it is the payout for this
            row's outcome and is `0` for a losing outcome; the rows of one

            `REDEEM` rows it identifies the outcome the row settles, not the
            market's winning outcome. `999` means the outcome could not be
            determined, in which case `outcome` is empty.
